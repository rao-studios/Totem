# Totem Skills

Maintenance, reference, and operational knowledge for every system in Totem. Use these when building new features, auditing existing behavior, writing tests, or debugging distributed search.

## System Map

| System | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Database** | Core actor: owns all search state, routes indexed writes, dispatches searches |
| **PartitionTable** | Multi-shard container: per-document PQ indices + HNSW proximity graph shards |
| **HNSW** | Approximate nearest-neighbor graph: multi-layer insert, beam search, shard auto-spawn |
| **PQ (PartitionQuantizer)** | Product quantization: compresses 1024-float vectors to compact UInt16 codes |
| **Registry** | Ownership layer: document-to-owner mapping, deduplication, access control |
| **GRPC** | Session stream: registers with Seer, dispatches bidirectional session messages |
| **Providers** | Embedding backends: Mistral API (priority queue) or on-device MLX |
| **Concurrency** | Mutators: serialized write paths for the registry and partition table |
| **Persistence** | WAL + mmap: append-only topology and registry logs, memory-mapped vector store |
| **API** | HTTP routes: standalone index/search/library/HNSW endpoints |
